       "On my first trip to the continent of Africa, I was lucky enough to spend about a week
       exploring the wonders of Cape Town. I ended up moving to Cape Town the following year,
       and called it my home for over three years! The coastal city has stunning natural
       landscapes, delicious and diverse cuisines, and so many activities for all ages. It's
       also a cosmopolitan city with a wealth of historical sites, cafe culture, and lively
       nightlife. Check out my Cape Town travel tips, including favorite places to eat, stay,
       and see!" == $0
